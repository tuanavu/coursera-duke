    "- So, we're told that 25.9% of this country's population is infected with HIV. So the probability of having HIV is 0.259. We also know something about the accuracy of the test, which seems to vary depending on whether the person has HIV or not. This is very common for medical tests. They tend to have different accuracy rates the, different accuracy rates for whether the patient has the disease or does not have the disease. \n",
    "- This statement, for those who carry HIV, the ELISA test is 99.7% accurate, basically means that probability of testing positive, because that's what an accurate result would be if a person has HIV, so probability of positive given HIV is 0.997. \n",
    "- This statement, for those who do not carry HIV, the test is 92.6% accurate, means probability of testing negative, because that's what accurate would mean in this case given that the patient does not have HIV, is 0.926. \n",
    "- The question says, if an individual from Swaziland has tested positive, what is the probability that he carries HIV? So what we know is that the person tested positive. We're looking to see what is the probability that they have HIV. What we can see here is that we have a situation where we're asked for a conditional probability, and the condition has been reversed from one of the things that we are given, and we should really think about a tree diagram in this case. Those tend to be the most effective methods for getting to the answer. There are definitely other ways that you can solve this problem, and you can organize the information that's given to you. But a tree diagram tends to be one where you can really efficiently and effectively organize the information that you're given. And you're going to get to the right answer if you do it the right way.

Some people in the population have HIV. That's the top branch. And others don't. That's the bottom branch. So probability of having HIV, as we saw, was 0.259 in Swaziland. \n",
    "- And the probability of not having HIV is the complement of that, 1 minus 0.259 is going to give us 0.741. So about 74.1% of the population in Swaziland does not have HIV. Note that probabilities on a set of branches always add up to 1.\n",
    "- Next, we move on to conditional probabilities. Let's start with the part of the population who has HIV, so we're going to be working with the top branch here. When these people take the test, they may get a positive or a negative result, because the test isn't 100% accurate. Therefore, we divide up the HIV population into two, those who test positive, and those who test negative. Based on information on the test that we were provided earlier, we know that the probability of testing positive, if someone has HIV is 0.997. "

Remember, our goal is to find the probability of having HIV, given that the patient has tested positive. Which based on Bayes theorem should be probability of HIV and positive divided by probability of testing positive. Remember, the numerator is always the joint probability, and the denominator is the marginal probability of what we're conditioning on. So far, we don't have the building blocks we need to calculate the probability that we're interested in. "

So what we get is 0.259 from the first branch times 0.997 from the second branch, which gives up 0.2582.
